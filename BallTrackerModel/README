# BallTrackerModel

A 2D soccer-ball tracking pipeline that processes video frames, detects the ball, and assigns consistent IDs over time.

## 🔍 Overview

This module implements a real-time “detect-then-track” approach:

1. **Detection**: Uses a YOLOv8 model fine-tuned on a soccer-ball dataset (`model_ball.pt`) to localize the ball in each frame.  
2. **Tracking**: Associates detections across frames to maintain a single “ball” identity and smooth out missing detections.  

Results are visualized by drawing bounding boxes and confidence scores on each frame and saving an annotated video.
