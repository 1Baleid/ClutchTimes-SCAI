# FaceRecognition

A proof-of-concept for detecting and recognizing faces of players or staff in broadcast video.

## 🔍 Overview

This module uses a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Face Detection**: Locate faces in each video frame.  
2. **Face Recognition**: Match detected faces against a gallery of known profiles.  

It outputs annotated frames with player names or IDs.

## 📂 Files

- `FaceRecognition.ipynb` – Notebook that:
  - Loads face detection & embedding models  
  - Reads a set of “Profiles” images to build a gallery  
  - Processes video frames to recognize faces  
- `Profiles/` – Reference images of known individuals (one subfolder per identity).  
- `Reactions/` – Sample output snapshots (annotated faces).  
- `README` – (this file).  

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- `face_recognition` or `dlib`  
- `opencv-python`  
- `numpy`  

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
