# CameraOptimizationBasedOnCoordinates

A demonstration of how to trigger camera control actions (e.g. zoom, pan) based on on-field coordinates of the ball and players.

## üîç Overview

Given streaming (x,y) coordinates of tracked objects:

1. **Compute zones of interest** (e.g. ball entering penalty area).  
2. **Apply decision rules** to choose camera operations (e.g. zoom when ball is near goal).  
3. **Output commands** or simulation logs showing when the camera would pan/zoom.

This notebook shows how a live analytics system could automatically direct camera focus.
